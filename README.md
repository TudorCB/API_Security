# Api_testing_and_monitoring

The Api_testing_and_monitoring application is a comprehensive security service designed to perform automated security testing and real-time monitoring of APIs and applications for external customers. It offers a centralized platform for managing security assessments and gaining insights into application behavior, operating independently from the customer's development environments.

## Overview

The application is structured as a set of microservices, utilizing Node.js for the backend, Express for routing, and MongoDB for data storage. The frontend is developed using a modern framework like React, Vue, or Angular. It integrates with third-party security tools such as OWASP ZAP, Snyk, and SonarQube for security testing, and Istio and the ELK stack for monitoring and logging. The deployment is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes, potentially on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Features

1. **Security Testing**: Includes API Security Testing with dynamic analysis using OWASP ZAP and static code analysis with SonarQube. It also covers open-source security with dependency scanning using Snyk.
2. **Security Monitoring & Logging**: Features service mesh monitoring with Istio, centralized logging with the ELK stack, and optional runtime application self-protection (RASP) integration.
3. **User Interface & Reporting**: Provides a dashboard for visualizing security test results, vulnerability reports, and monitoring data, along with detailed reporting capabilities.
